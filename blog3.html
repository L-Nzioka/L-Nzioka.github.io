            <h1>Introduction to IoT Communication Protocols</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
              Well, how we humans can communicate with each other, same like these devices this can communicate with other devices through protocols which are known as IoT protocols. 
              The protocol is defined as a set of rules and regulation guidelines having how to react for commands from another device. 
              These protocols are very important while in communication devices. The general-purpose protocols like CDMA, WAP, etc are not suitable for this specific IoT technology.
            </p>
            

            <h1>Architecture of IoT</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
              There is no single consensus on architecture for IoT, which is agreed universally. 
              Different architectures have been proposed by different researchers.
              <br>
              <h3>Three and Five Layer Architecture</h3>
              <p>
                The most basic architecture is a three-layer architecture
              It was introduced in the early stages of research in this area.
               It has three layers, namely, the perception, network, and application layers.<br>
    
                <i>1. The perception layer</i> is the physical layer, which has sensors for sensing and gathering information about the environment. 
                    It senses some physical parameters or identifies other smart objects in the environment.
                    <br>
                <i>2. The network layer</i> is responsible for connecting to other smart things, network devices, and servers.
                    Its features are also used for transmitting and processing sensor data.<br>
                <i>3.The application layer</i> is responsible for delivering application specific services to the user. 
                    It defines various applications in which the Internet of Things can be deployed, for example, smart homes, smart cities, and smart health.
                    <br>
                    The five layers are perception, transport, processing, application, and business layers    
              
            <h1>Iot Communication</h1>
            <hr>
              <p>
                As the Internet of Things is growing very rapidly, there are a large number of heterogeneous smart devices connecting to the Internet. 
                IoT devices are battery powered, with minimal compute and storage resources. 
                Because of their constrained nature, there are <u>various communication challenges involved</u>, which are as:<br>

                <b>Addressing and identification: </b>since millions of smart things will be connected to the Internet, 
                they will have to be identified through a unique address, on the basis of which they communicate with each other. <br>
                For this, we need a large addressing space, and a unique address for each smart object.<br>
                <b>Low power communication: </b>communication of data between devices is a power consuming task, specially, wireless communication. 
                Therefore, we need a solution that facilitates communication with low power consumption.<br>
                Routing protocols with low memory requirement and efficient communication patterns.<br>
                High speed and nonlossy communication.<br>
                Mobility of smart things.<br>
               </p>
   

              <h1>IoT protocols: How IoT devices communicate with the network</h1>
              <hr>
              <p>
                IoT devices communicate using IoT protocols. 
                Internet protocol (IP) is a set of rules that dictates how data gets sent to the internet.
                IoT protocols ensure that information from one device or sensor gets read and understood by another device, a gateway, a service. 
                Different IoT protocols have been designed and optimized for different scenarios and usage.
              </p>

                <h1>What IoT protocol is right for me?</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>
                The type of IoT protocol you’ll need depends on the system architecture layer that the data will travel in. 
                The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model provides a map of the various layers that send and receive data. 
                Each IoT protocol in the IoT system architecture enables device-to-device, device-to-gateway, gateway-to-data center, or gateway-to-cloud communication, as well as communication between data centers.
                <br>
              
                <br><b>Application layer</b><br>
                The application layer serves as the interface between the user and the device within a given IoT protocol.<br>

                <i>1. Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)</i><br>
                A software layer that creates interoperability between messaging middleware. 
                It helps a range of systems and applications work together, creating standardized messaging on an industrial scale.<br>

                A versatile peer-to-peer communication protocol that does everything from running tiny devices to connecting high-performance networks.
                DDS streamlines deployment, increases reliability, and reduces complexity.<br>

                <i>4. Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT)</i><br>
                A messaging protocol designed for lightweight machine-to-machine communication and primarily used for low-bandwidth connections to remote locations. 
                MQTT uses a publisher-subscriber pattern and is ideal for small devices that require efficient bandwidth and battery use.<br>
                
          
                <br><b>Transport layer</b><br>
                In any IoT protocol, the transport layer enables and safeguards the communication of the data as it travels between layers.<br>

                <i>1. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</i><br>
                The dominant protocol for a majority of internet connectivity. 
                It offers host-to-host communication, breaking large sets of data into individual packets and resending and reassembling packets as needed.<br>

                <i>2. User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</i><br>
                A communications protocol that enables process-to-process communication and runs on top of IP. 
                UDP improves data transfer rates over TCP and best suits applications that require lossless data transmissions.<br>

                <br><b>Network layer</b><br>
                The network layer of an IoT protocol helps individual devices communicate with the router.<br>

                <i>1. IP</i><br>
                Many IoT protocols utilize IPv4, while more recent executions use IPv6. 
                This recent update to IP routes traffic across the internet and identifies and locates devices on the network.<br>

                <i>2. 6LoWPAN</i><br>
                This IoT protocol works best with low-power devices that have limited processing capabilities.<br>

                <br><b>Data link layer</b><br>
                The data layer is the part of an IoT protocol that transfers data within the system architecture, identifying and correcting errors found in the physical layer.<br>

                <i>1. IEEE 802.15.4</i><br>
                A radio standard for low-powered wireless connection. It’s used with Zigbee, 6LoWPAN, and other standards to build wireless embedded networks.<br>

                <i>2. LPWAN</i><br>
                Low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN) networks enable communication across distances of 500 meters to over 10km in some places. 
                LoRaWAN is an example of LPWAN that’s optimized for low power consumption.<br>

                <br><b>Physical layer</b><br>
                The physical layer is the communication channel between devices within a specific environment.<br>

                <i>1. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)</i><br>
                BLE dramatically reduces power consumption and cost and maintains a similar connectivity range as classic Bluetooth. 
                BLE works natively across mobile operating systems and is fast becoming a favorite for consumer electronics due to its low cost and long battery life.<br>
