            <h1>OSI Model Explained</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
              The OSI Model can be seen as a universal language for computer networking. 
              It’s based on the concept of splitting up a communication system into seven abstract layers, each one stacked upon the last.
              <br>

              <img src="./images/OSI model.png" alt="OSI model illustrated" />

              <h1>Why Does the OSI model matter</h1>
              <hr>
              <p>
              Although the modern Internet doesn’t strictly follow the OSI Model (it more closely follows the simpler Internet protocol suite), the OSI Model is still very useful for troubleshooting network problems. 
              Whether it’s one person who can’t get their laptop on the Internet, or a web site being down for thousands of users, the OSI Model can help to break down the problem and isolate the source of the trouble. 
              If the problem can be narrowed down to one specific layer of the model, a lot of unnecessary work can be avoided.<br>
              </p>


              <h1>What are the seven layers of OSI Model?</h1>
              <hr>
              <p>

              <h3>The Application Layer</h3>
              <p>
                This is the only layer that directly interacts with data from the user. 
                Software applications like web browsers and email clients rely on the application layer to initiate communications. 
                But it should be made clear that client software applications are not part of the application layer; rather the application layer is responsible for the protocols and data manipulation that the software relies on to present meaningful data to the user.
                Application layer protocols include HTTP as well as SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is one of the protocols that enables email communications).
                <center><img src="./images/App.png" alt="" /></center>
              </p>
           



              <h3>The Presentation Layer</h3>
              <p>
                This layer is primarily responsible for preparing data so that it can be used by the application layer; in other words, layer 6 makes the data presentable for applications to consume.
                The presentation layer is responsible for translation, encryption, and compression of data.
                <br>
                <center><img src="./images/pres.png" alt="" /></center>
              </p>
              



              <h3>The Session Layer</h3>
                <p>
                  This is the layer responsible for opening and closing communication between the two devices. 
                  The time between when the communication is opened and closed is known as the session.
                  The session layer ensures that the session stays open long enough to transfer all the data being exchanged, and then promptly closes the session in order to avoid wasting resources.
                  <center><img src="./images/sess.png" alt="" /></center>
                </p>
             



              <h3>The Transport Layer</h3>
              <p>
                Layer 4 is responsible for end-to-end communication between the two devices. 
                This includes taking data from the session layer and breaking it up into chunks called segments before sending it to layer 3. 
                The transport layer on the receiving device is responsible for reassembling the segments into data the session layer can consume.
                <center><img src="./images/trans.png" alt="" /></center>
              </p>
              


              <h3>The Network Layer</h3>
              <p>
                The network layer is responsible for facilitating data transfer between two different networks. 
                If the two devices communicating are on the same network, then the network layer is unnecessary. 
                The network layer breaks up segments from the transport layer into smaller units, called packets, on the sender’s device, and reassembling these packets on the receiving device.
                The network layer also finds the best physical path for the data to reach its destination; this is known as <u>routing.</u>
              </p>
              <center><img src="./images/net.png" alt="" /></center>


              <h3>The Data Link Layer</h3>
              <p>
                The data link layer takes packets from the network layer and breaks them into smaller pieces called frames. 
                Like the network layer, the data link layer is also responsible for flow control and error control in intra-network communication
                (The transport layer only does flow control and error control for inter-network communications).
                <center><img src="./images/data.png" alt="" /></center>
              </p>
              

              <h3>The Physical Layer</h3>
              <p>
              This layer includes the physical equipment involved in the data transfer, such as the cables and switches. 
              This is also the layer where the data gets converted into a bit stream, which is a string of 1s and 0s.
              <center><img src="./images/physical.png" alt="" /></center>
            </p>
            </p>
